# homepage

This is the solution for problem set from the course CS50 presented by Harvard Univesity.

The main goal was to create a homepage which comply with the requirements.

Important note: As each of the problem set had to be solved during 1 week and comply with the requirements, I did not pay attention to the detailed structure, design, etc.
